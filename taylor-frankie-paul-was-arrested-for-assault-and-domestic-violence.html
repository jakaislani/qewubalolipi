According to Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office records, the 28-year-old celebrity was apprehended Saturday in Utah’s Herriman and taken into custody at 1.56 a.m. that same day.</strong></p><p>At around 10.35 a.m., Frankie was released on three minor charges: criminal damage, domestic violence in the presence of a child, and assault. She and her ex-husband Tate Paul have two children: a two-year-old boy named Ocean and a five-year-old daughter named Indy.</p><p>Dakota Mortensen, her current partner, declined to comment, telling the Daily Mail that he was not even allowed to speak with her. Dakota, on the other hand, claimed that Frankie never hurt anyone on purpose. The city attorney’s office and Herriman Police Department have not made the allegations public. Matt Brooks, the deputy prosecutor, told the outlet:</p><p><strong>“I haven’t seen the Taylor Paul dossier yet. If it comes across my desk, I’ll look into it like any other matter.”</strong></p><p>Taylor Frankie’s Paul has previously revealed on the internet her “gentle swaying” behavior.</p><h2>Taylor Frankie has a celebrity is going through a lot, according to Paul’s partner</h2><p>Frankie’s Paul sparked outrage last May when she revealed online that she and her husband, Tate, were “swingers,” who engaged in s**ual activity in the same room, switching partners within their close-knit group of friends, but with certain restrictions. Tate Paul filed for divorce after admitting to going “too far” with someone else’s partner on TikTok.</p><p>She admitted to breaking the soft-swinging deal she made with her influential friends early last year. Frankie stated that she was about to lose everything. Taylor uploaded mysterious TikTok videos in May 2022, claiming that her life was falling apart. In some of the recordings, she can be seen shifting crates. The celebrity also mentioned starting therapy.</p><p>Dakota Mortensen, Paul’s 30-year-old partner at Taylor Frankie, stated:</p><p><strong>“I really don’t want to talk about it, but there are a few things I need to clarify. I didn’t call 911.”</strong></p><p>Dakota suspected a neighbor had called the cops. He refused to say anything about what happened after they got home. Dakota continued, saying:</p><p><strong>“I’m going to wait for everything to come out before I comment on it. She never intentionally harmed anyone.”</strong></p><p>The Daily Mail pressed Dakota for more information, but Dakota refused to elaborate. Dakota, on the other hand, stated that he and Frankie did not fight. He stated, ”</p><p><strong>“I don’t want the truth to be revealed. She’s in such a bad way right now. I attempted to help her. She’s a good mother going through a difficult period in her life. Taylor has been in pain; she has had a difficult year. She is haunted by remorse for the adultery that cost her marriage.”</strong></p><p>Taylor Frankie’s According to Dakota, Paul attended a ‘Galentine’s Day gathering’ on Friday night. After Valentine’s Day, a female gathering was planned. He stated that after picking Taylor up from the gathering, he drove her home. Dakota Mortensen, on the other hand, believes Taylor’s incarceration was a watershed moment and that she will only grow stronger as a result.</p><p>Taylor revealed Dakota as her boyfriend on TikTok in July 2022, during her divorce. Despite the fact that their brief relationship ended six months after Taylor’s birth, they quickly reconnected. In January, the two appeared together in a TikTok video. Taylor Frankie Paul opened up about her depression in August 2022, revealing that she had lost nearly 90 pounds. Dakota recently told the Daily Mail that he adores Taylor and wishes to be with her in the future. He also confirmed that they live in separate homes about 20 miles apart.</p><p>He stated that they would have to wait and see how the capture turned out after it went through the system’s processes. Dakota was unsure when he would be able to see or speak with Taylor Frankie Paul again. He estimated that it could take days, weeks, or even months.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>tiktok celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Meagan G</a></h3>Meagan G estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
