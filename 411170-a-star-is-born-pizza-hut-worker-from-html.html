Upon her appearance on the stage, she confessed that she hadn't performed live much and was nervous.</p><p class=Fg>She explained that she was trying to make music her career by putting herself out there and fighting the anxiety she got. Rios hoped her singing capabilities would finally free her from her dreaded pizza-making.</p><p class=Fg>The teenager had worked from morning until they closed at Pizza Hut for about a year because she was trying to afford her bills and other things. The youngster happened to reveal that she and her ex-boyfriend <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjVKWpp8Jh8">used to work together</a>, and when asked if she hoped he was watching, she hilariously disagreed.</p><p class=Fg>The spunky teenager said if her ex was watching, she wished he was doing well before taking the words back! AGT judge, Simon Cowell, told her everyone was rooting for her before she started her stunning rendition of <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/08/03/zach-bryan-praises-19-year-old-pizza-hut-manager-summer-rios-performance-of-something-in-the-orange-on-americas-got-talent/>Zach Bryan's "Something In the Orange."</a></p><p class=Fg>Rios started singing softly before showing the range of her voice when she hit the highest notes without breaking a sweat! When she finished, she received a standing ovation from the audience and judges Heidi Klum and Sofia Vergara!</p><p class=Fg>Judge <a class="Xd a" href=#>Howie Mandel</a> praised her, saying singing should be the teenager's focus instead of slicing pizza. Mandel thought they'd gotten a glimpse of what Rios was capable of, and since she'd opened a crack in the door, she was ready to launch!</p><p class=Fg>Klum loved the teenager's performance and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjVKWpp8Jh8">thought</a> it seemed like she'd "swallowed Rihanna" because of how similar their voices sounded. The judge felt Rios' tone of voice was beautiful and incredible, while Vergara called it "spectacular."</p><p class=Fg>She urged the young girl not to waste more time because she belonged onstage. Cowell thought the girl's song choice was "great" and revealed all the people there wanted the Ohio teenager to do well, and they all liked her.</p><p class=Fg>The judges rounded things off nicely by giving Rios four "yes's," leaving Rios to run off celebrating before calling a family member to inform them of her win. Social media fans loved the Pizza Hut manager!</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>What Did Fans Think About Summer's Cover?</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>The clip of Rios' performance was shared on AGT's YouTube channel, and it elicited many comments from people who were impressed with the teenager.
