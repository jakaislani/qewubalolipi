But although a number of actors come from long lines of performers, a few had to make a name for themselves without the support of wealthy parents. Among these is the "Ghost" star, Demi Moore who turned 60 on November 11.</p><p class=dh>Demetria Guynes was born on November 11, 1962. Her mother and father split up before she was born, and instead, she was raised by her mother and stepfather. Unfortunately, he had trouble holding down a job, and the family moved around a lot.</p><p class=dh>After dropping out of school early, Demi briefly worked as a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/demi-moore/>debt collector</a> before securing a role on the television soap opera, "General Hospital." She also had other parts in small films and shows, but her big break wouldn't come until later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9091fd4c0d2ec1ae4d276e88b656845a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Demi Moore at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival, 1899 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After her time on "General Hospital," the actress starred in a few minor films. She married Freddie Moore in 1981 and starred in the sci-fi horror "Parasite" alongside him. Finally, in 1985, she had her big break with the movie "St. Elmo's Fire."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Demi Won't Look Matronly</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>After her breakout movie, she continued to star in a few big films, building a reputation for herself with each one. Eventually, she divorced her first husband and ended up married to action star Bruce Willis. The two had <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/actor/demi-moore>three children</a> together before divorcing as well, although the two remained friends.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>So, Demi decided to speak out against the discriminating approach the American movie industry has taken to selecting its actors.</strong></h3><p class=dh>As she grew older, Demi started feeling the pressures of Hollywood. Before her role in the film "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle," she reportedly spent a small fortune on cosmetic surgery, trying to counteract the effects of aging. Eventually, she came to terms with her body, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/demi-moore-reveals-now-looks-15231584>stating</a>:</p><p class=dh>"But I feel for myself it's about acceptance… embracing it and no longer looking for what's wrong – just being accepting of everything."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/cd1969a1fa0f4d485c7523bfd8c34a42.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Demi Moore pose at the after-party for "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" at the Chinese Theater on June 18, 2003 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Now that she's almost 60, the actress has started encouraging other women not to feel "matronly or not feel sexy" as they grow older. Demi partnered with the brand Andie to design a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/style/demi-moore-psyched-to-turn-60-exclusive-interview/>swimwear collection</a> to combat this sentiment in women.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Taking on Hollywood</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Her new swimwear line isn't the first time the actress has stood up for women and their perception in the public eye. When she turned 40, Demi noticed that roles in big films were becoming suspiciously scarce. And she realized that few films star women over 40 for anything other than a mother or a wife. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-481455/Shes-spent-226k-plastic-surgery-I-Hollywood-says-Demi.html>noted</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It's been a challenging few years, being the age that I am. Almost to the point where I felt like, well, they don't know what to do with me. I am not 20. Not 30."</p><p class=dh>Demi isn't the first to complain about the rampant ageism in Hollywood, either. Sharon Stone compared being a 40-year-old at the Oscars to a fossil. Even British actress Charlotte Rampling noted that it is more challenging for older actors in Hollywood than in Europe.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>But, despite those hoping to bring her down, an armada of supporters cheered her on.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ee788c9fa81a94840c62f43f14b762d4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Demi Moore attends The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2019 in New York City | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>So, Demi decided to speak out against the discriminating approach the American movie industry has taken to selecting its actors. The actress said she looked forward to "not being defined by a number and instead being defined by my experience."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Demi Still Battles Her Comment Section</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Despite the "Forsaken" actress' efforts, many people still look down on older women. Her very own comment section on Instagram can become quite vile and filled with disparaging statements made by hateful individuals.</p><p class=dh>Some commenters have focussed on minor issues to belittle her, like saying that her knees look old, while others have downright told her to give up. One person, in particular, said, "Ok Grandma, time to change the diaper," in response to a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CiLGh-POoxq/>bikini picture</a> the actress posted.</p><p class=dh>But, despite those hoping to bring her down, an armada of supporters cheered her on. Many fans flocked to her Instagram with comments comparing her to a "Greek goddess." Some praised her swimsuits and said she looked great in them, while others encouraged her with a simple, "Looking great."</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>The daughters celebrated their family bond on Mother's day by honoring Demi.</strong></h3><p class=dh>In the post, the actress simply showed off two swimsuits, presumably from her designer collection. Demi can be seen standing on a boat in one and lying down on the hull in the next. The image is captioned briefly, "The last days of summer."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Focusing On Family</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>These days, Demi decided to appreciate the good things in life instead of focusing on all the negative and hateful opinions and commentary. The actress shares three daughters with her ex-husband, Bruce Willis. She is very close with her daughters, Rumer, Scout LaRue, and Tallulah Willis.</p><p class=dh>Despite Bruce and Demi's divorce, the two have remained close. They decided early on that they would work together to raise their children. The entire "blended family," as Demi puts it, even spent the lockdown together – Bruce and his family, Demi, their daughters, and Demi's boyfriend, Daniel Humm.</p><p class=dh>The choice to raise their children together turned out to be a brilliant strategy. Unlike many other divorced couples, Demi and Bruce managed to put their differences aside for the sake of their children. Rumer <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/demi-moore-told-bruce-willis-she-is-thankful-for-our-blended-family-2-weeks-before-diagnosis-reveal/>commented</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm incredibly grateful that both of my parents have made such an effort my entire life that I never felt like I had to choose between them... I feel so grateful that my parents made it such a priority that we could be a family, even though it looked different."</p><p class=dh>The daughters celebrated their family bond on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/20220508139692/demi-moore-emotional-family-photo-daughters-rumer-scout-tallulah-mothers-day/>Mother's day</a> by honoring <a class="me a" href=#>Demi</a>. Later, Bruce was diagnosed with aphasia and announced his retirement from acting. The family posted together, "As Bruce always says, 'Live it up' and together we plan to do just that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcGtjaHqlscyiZKann6eybq%2FApaOenF2cv6K6zbJkraecmXqktMCnnp5llJ6ub7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gia-sinatra.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gia Sinatra">&larr;
