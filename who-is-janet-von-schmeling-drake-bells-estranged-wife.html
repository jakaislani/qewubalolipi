Luckily, he was found and is reportedly out of danger now.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>In view of his sudden, unexpected disappearance and discovery, the actor’s personal life has come under renewed focus, with the lion’s share of interest going toward Bell’s estranged wife, <strong>Janet Von Schmeling</strong>.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Turns out that for years, the 36-year-old actor successfully kept his family life and romance with Janet under wraps. So much so that their marriage in 2018 never initially received any media attention.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>It was only after the couple welcomed their son in 2021 that Bell tweeted his marriage of three years with Janet writing, “In response to various rumors that are incorrect, I have been married for almost 3 years, and we are blessed to be the parents of a wonderful son. Thank you very much to all my fans around the world for your good wishes.”</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>How much do we really know about Janet Von Schmeling? A sizable amount, it turns out.</p><h2 id=h-what-do-we-know-about-janet-von-schmeling data-injectable=false><strong>What do we know about Janet Von Schmeling?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Schmeling.png><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Janet Von Schmeling is a 27-year-old actor and producer who starred in the 2017 series Painting Autumn, where she played Tawny, as well as a Buzzfeed video series, Murder Mystery Stories, which was released in the same year. In addition, she also appeared in Just Jenna (2016) and How to Survive High School (2015).</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Outside of her acting career, Schmeling is also reportedly a member of the PR firm, Decibel Media Group, of which Drake was also a client. After the duo was romantically linked in 2017, they were frequently spotted together at public events, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EcoLuxe Lounge’s 10th Anniversary in Los Angeles, California</a>.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>They were also spotted in Disneyland, California wearing their wedding rings the following year. Besides maintaining a relatively lower profile and seemingly accompanying her former husband, Janet’s comment against Josh Peck, Drake’s former co-star from Drake & Josh, hit headlines, bringing her under public scrutiny.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>In 2022, she mentioned Josh Peck in her story, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stating</a>, “Anytime anybody asked about Josh I would say, ‘He is so nice. Oh, they are so great.’ I am done lying to everyone&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when Josh Peck is a total piece of s—t</a>. I stay quiet until lies happen.” This was in response to Josh’s attempts in a 2017 podcast to put down Drake and present him as a liar.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Apart from the troubles, the couple seemingly led a happy life away from the spotlight until they decided to call it quits in late 2022. As per Schmeling, the healing from the separation was painful but she claimed to be going strong for her child.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Commenting on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram </a>she said, “I’m HEALING and trying to find peace. This will be a process. My son is with me and will stay with me, we are in Florida with family and we are safe. We are finding our forever home here.”</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>The definite reasons for the breakup are unknown, but according to a source closer to the couple, they are on cordial terms and devoting their time to co-parenting.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=false>Today, Schmeling is living with their son, and with Drake’s discovery, the former couple will probably continue raising their child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmopGjsrV51ailZquTnbqmuMinnmacopa4pnnBnqOlq12awLW%2BwKeenpxdrLansY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./25-stylish-layered-haircuts-for-little-girls.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="25 Stylish Layered Haircuts For Little Girls">&larr;
