She noted that King and her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">husband of eight years</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Tucker</a>, had previous “business issues” due to them working together for a production company that they all were trying to move past.</p><p>She continued, “Let’s say the season [nine] wrapped in November, in December I was talking to a friend I was like, ‘Hey, we should do a movie about you know our group’s life’’ and they were like — it was a director that Todd and I were speaking with and they were like ‘Somebody’s already doing that,’ and I was like, ‘What you mean somebody’s doing that?’”</p><p>Burruss initially thought one of her group members brought the idea to the director, however she quickly learned it was King who not only pitched the idea, but he sold it to TV One. According to Burruss, King’s producing partner got in contact with her mother, Mama Joyce, in an attempt to receive additional information about Xscape for the film.&nbsp;</p><p>“My mom was going to do it but come to find out he was the person who had did the deal to TV One to sell our life story, and he was gonna try to ask my mother questions about us unknowingly to get more information I guess for the show.”&nbsp;</p><p>Although King didn’t obtain cooperation from the group Xscape’s story, Burruss conceded that any individual is legally entitled to create “unauthorized stories” about another person.</p><p>Burruss’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eyes filled with tears</a> as she called the situation “the lowest of the low.” She claimed she reached out to King for clarification surrounding their circumstances, but to her dismay the producer did not respond back until Burruss tried to get the situation shut down by involving the network.&nbsp;</p><p>As the interview came to a close, Burruss said King’s life-story film was shut down, and she even suggested she’d be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interested in a truthful life-story</a> film with all of her former Xscape group members as long as, “Everybody is going to be open and honest about their stuff and not just my drama or my tea.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze49yZmprX6m1pnnLqK6eq6RivKd506GcZqSfrHqsrc2doGaapae%2Ftr%2FSZpqlmZmiwG60xKtkoqujqrJuw8itn2abkae5sL%2BMpKCnn12ewG6tjKucrK2cqXqwsoyhoKZlpJa4qrrGZq%2Bsm5GlsrR5y6KdnmWjqbyzxYyapZ1lo5q5rbXNoGSirF2strW0zq6rZp%2BipMKxv4ycpqiolaeutbXOp2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-joji-obara-now-the-subject-of-netflixs-missing-the-lucie-blackman-case.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Joji Obara now?
