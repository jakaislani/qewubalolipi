"Apparently weary of the sounds that made them the idols of the millions, they here explore all manner of unlikely musical necks of the woods... You’ve heard 'The Tide is High,' on the radio, so you don’t need the Times to tell you how perfectly delightful this tuneful, horn-decorated reggae oldie is."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two of the album's biggest hit songs, "The Tide is High" and "Rapture," broke new ground in the music world, crossing genres and creating a sound that mainstream music had never heard before.</p><img alt="Debbie Harry and Chris Stein" title="Debbie Harry and Chris Stein" width=4659 height=4688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-583735633.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Debbie Harry and Chris Stein in May 1979; Photo: Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Blondie wanted to create hybrid forms of music</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Blondie’s decision to record Autoamerican was partly political — an attempt to create new hybrid forms of cross-cultural music for a more tolerant generation. “We wanted to make music that would cross over,” Blondie guitarist <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.pomoculture.org/2013/09/03/coloring-between-the-lines-of-punk-and-hardcore-from-absence-to-black-punk-power/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chris Stein said" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Chris Stein said</a>. “I would like to see the record resolve racial tensions by bringing different audiences together. When the new wave kids and the rapper kids get together, that'll be something. Eventually, they'll all meet in the middle, where you'll have a strong race of young people that won't be divided by stupid racial issues.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1980, Blondie traveled from their natural habitat of New York City’s Lower East Side to the legendary United Western Record studio on the Sunset Strip to record the album.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Every day we get up, stagger into the blinding sun, drive past a huge moon-mobile, from some ancient sci-fi movie that lies rotting by the side of the road into LA Proper.

"I first heard 'The Tide Is High' on a compilation tape that someone had given me while we were in London. Chris (Stein) and I both fell in love with the song and decided it was too good to resist," she recalled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The Tide is High” was written by reggae legend John Holt, known as “Mr. Loverman,” for his smooth, playful sounds. The plaintive love song was originally recorded in 1967 by his trio The Paragons. On the original version, “White Rum” Raymond’s plaintive violin weaves throughout the song of unrequited love, giving it a whimsical edge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/john-lennon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Lennon" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">John Lennon</a> was a huge fan of “The Tide is High.’’ "The one modern song I remember him listening to was 'The Tide Is High' by Blondie, which he played constantly," his son <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/sean-lennon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Sean class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Sean</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-sean-lennon-105993/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">told Rolling Stone</a> in 2006. "When I hear that song, I see my father, unshaven, his hair pulled back into a ponytail, dancing to and fro in a worn-out pair of denim shorts, with me at his feet, trying my best to coordinate tiny limbs."</p><img alt="Blondie Debbie Harry" title="Blondie Debbie Harry" width=4445 height=4354 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-98589653.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: David Redfern/Redferns</span></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Debbie believes "Rapture" made rap 'viable for the mainstream charts'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The album also featured the song “Rapture,” a playful take on the word rap, which they had been introduced to by fellow outlaw artists in New York City like rap pioneer Fab 5 Freddy. “I knew Chris and Debbie from the downtown art scene and would visit their apartment,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nypost.com/2014/05/10/how-blondie-became-one-of-nycs-most-iconic-bands/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Freddy recalled" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Freddy recalled</a> to the New York Post. “Chris had the best marijuana and Debbie would offer me a sandwich. It was funny to see the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marilyn-monroe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marilyn Monroe" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Marilyn Monroe</a> of her generation being domestic! They were supporters of what was happening in the Bronx before anyone [else].”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry would honor her friend in “Rapture” with the line: "Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody's fly / DJ's spinnin' I said, 'My my' / Flash is fast, Flash is cool / François sais pas, Flashé no deux."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While “Rapture” was the first mainstream number one hit, Harry today downplays its importance. “Creatively it did one thing in particular: It was the first rap song to have its own original music,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-debbie-harry-183564/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Rolling Stone</a>. “Commercially it made rap viable for the mainstream charts. I don’t think it was a tremendous influence. I am nowhere close to being a rapper. I’m completely in awe of great rappers.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Rapture” was the first time many Americans were exposed to this new art form. “U-God and Inspectah Deck from the Wu-Tang Clan once told me that ‘Rapture’ was the first rap song they ever heard as kids,” Stein told the New York Post. “That’s mind-boggling.”</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Reggae and rap artists banned together to fight the mainstream music culture</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For many in the punk scene, reggae and rap artists were fellow musical mates in the fight against the mainstream. Harry was a regular at London clothing store Acme Attractions, along with punk rockers like <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/patti-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Patti Smith" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Patti Smith</a> and Chrissie Hynde.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was a culture that spoke in a currency with which the punks could identify," Letts told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/oct/24/artsfeatures4 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Guardian class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Guardian</a>. "It was the soundbite-type lyrics, the anti-fashion fashion, the rebel stance and, importantly, the fact that reggae was a kind of musical reportage, talking about things that mattered."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unfortunately, Autoamerican would be Blondie’s last great success. In 1982, things came to a head during a show at the Providence Civic Center when bandmates threw drumsticks at each other during a fight. They would break up shortly after. But their groundbreaking hits would live on, encouraging people to enjoy and explore life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJomaWnnpm2pnnDnpmboZVitaK%2B0bJkq5mgqcKzsYytoJ2dXZ7AbrTIoJ8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./can-you-go-to-jail-for-driving-without-a-license-uk.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can you go to jail for driving without a license UK?">&larr;
