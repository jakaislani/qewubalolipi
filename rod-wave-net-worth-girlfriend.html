One billion views on YouTube equates to approximately $3 million, so we can reasonably say that Wave has earned at least $12 million (before taxes) from YouTube ads alone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His videos regularly receive tens of millions of views. For instance, the official video for “Heart on Ice” has racked up more than 173 million views, and it’s undoubtedly the track that put Rod Wave on the map.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Other popular releases for the musician include “Letter from Houston” and “Girl of my Dreams,” racking up 89 million and 72 million views, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Wave released Ghetto Gospel in 2019, he couldn’t possibly have imagined the incredible success it would enjoy. It peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200, and he followed it up with Pray 4 Love, which sat at number 2 on the charts the following year.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51307 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rod-Wave-girlfriend.jpg.webp alt width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rod-Wave-girlfriend.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-51307 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This wasn’t enough for Wave, and his third album, Soulfly, debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, securing his first chart-topping album at only the third attempt.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Florida-born rapper might be relatively new to the scene, but his incredibly fast rise to the top has seen him make a name for himself in hip-hop already.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Although he became popular as a result of a viral hit, Rod Wave is now involved in various rap labels, including Alamo, Geffen, Interscope, and Hit House.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He also regularly collaborates with other artists, including Kevin Gates, which has helped him build his profile as a rap artist.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As a direct result of the success of his first three albums, Rod Wave has enjoyed huge financial success off the back of his music.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He racks up millions of streams on the likes of Spotify and Apple Music, and his star will continue shining bright when his next studio album drops.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Another source of revenue for the popular hip-hop star is touring, and he regularly plays sold-out venues at different locations.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For such a relatively new act, it’s hard to think of Rod Wave’s story and not be impressed.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He has received praise from various sources in the music industry for his talent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On Instagram, Wave has around 6.5 million followers, and he keeps them updated with the goings-on in his career. It’s not clear if Wave makes money through brand endorsements on the platform, but given his reputation, it’s no doubt another potential revenue stream for the star.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As a result of his incredible success since going viral with “Heart on Ice,” Rod Wave has become a much-loved mainstream musician in no time at all.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Therefore, American hip-hop star Rod Wave has an estimated net worth of $8 million.</span></p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Michael Galeotti biography</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfp7yledaarZ5lnprBbsPOq6uhZZeev62y0aKcp5xf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sundance-x-chicago-brings-films-premier-festival-to-the-windy-city.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sundance x Chicago Brings Film's Premier Festival to the Windy City | Features">&larr;
