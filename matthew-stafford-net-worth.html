compensation.</p><p>With his massive annual salary, Stafford ranks sixth in the highest-paid NFL players list, tying the spot with Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Similarly, the quarterback has also been a frequent guest in Forbes’s list of highest-earning athletes over the years.</p><p>In 2022 alone, Matthew raked in <strong>$72.3 million</strong> from NFL salaries and endorsements, which was enough to make him the <a href=#>13th highest-paid athlete globally</a>.</p><p>Out of the total amount, he made <strong>$69.8 million</strong> on the field, and the remaining amount of <strong>$2.5 million</strong> came off the field.</p><p>He even surpassed fellow quarterback for Green Bay Packers, <a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>, and golfer <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> among others, with astonishing earnings.</p><h3>NFL Contracts</h3><h4>Detroit Lions</h4><p>After getting drafted by Detroit Lions in 2009, Matthew signed six years <strong>$72 million</strong> rookie contract.</p><p>With <strong>$48,400,000</strong> guaranteed on the sign and a total guarantee of the same amount, his average annual salary was<strong> $12 million</strong> as per the

million.</strong></p><h4>Los Angeles Rams</h4><p>In 2021, Matthew was traded to Los Angeles Rams with two seasons remaining in the ongoing five years contract.</p><p>Nevertheless, Stafford signed a four-year, <strong>$160 million</strong> contract with the Los Angeles Rams in March 2022, including a <strong>$60 million</strong> signing bonus and <strong>$130 million</strong> guaranteed.</p><p>Similarly, his average annual salary, according to the contract, is <strong>$40 million.</strong></p><p>In 2022, Stafford earned a base salary of <strong>$1.5 million</strong> and a
