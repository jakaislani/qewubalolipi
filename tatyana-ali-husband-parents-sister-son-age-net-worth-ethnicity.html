Ali graduated in 2002 and put her knowledge and influence as a television star in supporting Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008.</p><p>Tatyana was once one of the most popular faces on television at such a young age and it was a journey that started at the age of 6 in 1985. She had been singing since the age of 4 and her passion caused her to encourage her mother to sign her up for an audition on the show, Sesame Street. Her insistence and passion paid off and at the age of 6, she was a child performer on the show, appearing with other actors like Herbie Hancock on the show.</p><p>Ali’s performance on Sesame Street and her continued interest in being an actress got her other roles in other television shows, such as A Man Called Hawk, The Cosby Show, Star Search, and a TV Movie, Wally and the Valentines which eventually landed her a role on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, where she got her breakthrough and hit national fame. She was cast in the in 1990 show, as Ashley Banks, one of the main characters of the classic show. She starred on the show for six years, appearing in a total of 147 episodes of the show.</p><p>Since she got her start in the industry as a singer, she got a few opportunities to showcase her singing talent on the show. This led to Will Smith, who was himself a rapper to encourage the actress to pursue a musical career. Tatyana Ali took Will’s advice to heart and prepared to launch a music career at the completion of the show. She released her debut album, ‘Kiss The Sky’ in 1998. The album charted across a couple of markets, including the US where it reached number 106 on the Billboard 200. It reached number 6 on the UK R&B chart and it was certified gold after a few months of release.</p><p>As her music career developed at a small but steady incremental pace, Tatyana continued to star in films and television shows. She appeared in films like Brother, Jawbreaker, National Lampoon Presents Dorm Daze, Back in the Day, and Hotel California. Back in music, she was part of the will.i.am song, ‘Yes We Can’ which was recorded and released in support of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008. She released her second music project, ‘Hello’, an Extended Play project in 2014, and it featured tracks like ‘Wait For It’.</p><p>She has received a few nominations and won a couple of awards for her career.
