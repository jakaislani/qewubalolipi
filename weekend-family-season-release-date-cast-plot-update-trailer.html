Fred and his wives, however separated, still have a healthy relationship taking care of their babies irrespective of their differences. Just like the name suggests, Fred is a single dad of three who has to take care of his three children for the weekend.</p><p>What makes it even better is that the series has been praised by French Fans for the captivating performance the casts pulled, the refreshing humor it weaved, and the gladdening dynamics between the <a href=#>family</a> members. But after all the positive critics are made, does the series stands a chance for a second season?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Weekend Family Season 2 Release Date: When will it be out?</h2><p>The <a href=#>series may have premiered on Disney</a> on the 9th of March 2022, but in some countries, it premiered much earlier on February 23rd, 2022. The first season had eight episodes, each with an estimated run time of 24-32 minutes, telling the story of the beautiful chemistry between the characters.</p><p>Despite the series having a 6.6/10 rating on IMDB, will are yet to receive an official announcement from the series network regarding a second installment. The series lived up to the audience’s expectations, making it likely to be renewed even brighter than when it was first released. If all goes as we wish, prepare for a humor-filled season in 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Weekend Family Season 2 Cast: Who will appear?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/weekend-family-cast.jpg><p>The series revolved around Fred, his family, and his love; therefore, in the case of season 2, we expect everybody in his circle to be reprising their roles. We might also see new talents in the next season. Erica Judor plays Fred, the single father with three daughters; Liona Bordonaro as Clara, Midie Dreyfus as Victoire, and Roxane Barrazuol as Romy. Their respective mothers Annelise Hesme as Laurence, Jeanne Bournaud as Marie-Ange, and Annabel Lopez as Helena, are on good terms but not romantically involved with Fred. Emma (Daphnee Cote Halle), Fred’s girlfriend, will also be back in the second season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Weekend Family Season 2 Plot: What should we expect?</h2><p>The show revolves around Fred, the single father with their different baby mamas juggling the relationship with all of them, his kids, while also <a href=#>dating</a> Emma, the child psychologist. In season one, we saw him and Emma try to make their relationship work while also focusing on the twisted family dynamic he has. When Mother’s Day finally comes, Emma, Emma is left questioning the position and the life she has just gotten herself involved in. Fred’s children were also worried about his relationship with Emma, and we saw the three of them trying to maintain the spark between them. With a potential season 2, we could see Emma transition into the new family, the relationship between Clara and Alexis, and Fred’s reaction to the new development.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Weekend Family Season 2 Trailer: Is there any trailer out?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Disney has yet to reveal a trailer for the second season, but it will be available for streaming once they are sure of a potential season 2. If you have not watched the first season, then checking out the season on a trailer on YouTube will convince you otherwise. You can also check out series that portray positive co-parenting, like <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy</a> on Hulu.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK571p6cpJ2emXqnrcyio7Jlo5qutLvNZqmepJWWwKZ5w5qrnmWTlsC1ec%2Blpq1lpaWxosDEZqurmZmhsrN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wwe-superstar-alerts-fans-of-fake-social-media-account.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE Superstar Alerts Fans Of Fake Social Media Account">&larr;
