She married a brick contractor in 1886 and left her teaching job, at which point she became more active within the Independent Order of St. Luke, an organization dedicated to the social and financial advancement of African Americans. In 1899, Walker became the grand secretary of the organization — a position that she would hold for the rest of her life. During her tenure, she founded the organization's newspaper and opened a highly successful bank and a department store. By the time she died, on December 15, 1934, Walker had turned the nearly bankrupt organization into a profitable and effective one.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Walker was born Maggie Lena Draper on July 15, 1864, in Richmond Virginia. Her mother, Elizabeth Draper, was a formerly enslaved and the assistant cook for Elizabeth Van Lew, an abolitionist on whose estate Walker was born. Walker's biological father was Eccles Cuthbert, an Irish American who had met Elizabeth on the Van Lew estate. The two were never married, and shortly after Walker's birth, Elizabeth married William Mitchell, the butler of the estate. In 1870, the Mitchells had a child, Walker's half-brother Johnnie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon thereafter, William obtained a job as the headwaiter at the St. Charles Hotel in Richmond, and the family moved away from the estate and into a small house of their own. Tragedy struck, however, when in 1876 William was found drowned in the river. His death was ruled a suicide by police, though Elizabeth maintained that he had been murdered. William's death left Elizabeth and her children in poverty. To make ends meet, Elizabeth began a laundry business, with which Walker assisted by delivering clean laundry to their white patrons. It was during this time that she first developed an awareness of the gap between the quality of life for white people and Blacks in the United States — a gap that she would soon devote her life to narrowing.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Independent Order of St. Luke</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In her teens, Walker attended the Lancaster School and, later, the Richmond Colored Normal School, both institutions dedicated to the education of African Americans. While attending the latter, she also joined the Independent Order of St. Luke, a fraternal organization dedicated to the advancement of African Americans in both financial and social standing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Walker graduated in 1883, having completed her training as a teacher. She returned to the Lancaster School to teach and remained there until 1886, when she married Armstead Walker Jr., a brick contractor, and was forced to leave her job, due to the school's policy against married teachers. Over the next decade, Walker's life was split between family and her work for the Order of St. Luke. In 1890, she gave birth to her first son, Russell, and in 1893, Armstead, who died while still an infant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1895, Walker, who had been rising quickly through the ranks of the Order, became grand deputy matron. She also established a youth arm of the order to inspire social consciousness in young African Americans. In 1897, Walker gave birth to another son, Melvin, and two years later, became the Order of St. Luke's grand secretary.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Grand Secretary</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Walker assumed control of the Order of St. Luke, the organization was on the verge of bankruptcy. In a speech she gave in 1901, she outlined her plans to save it, and in the coming years, she would follow through on each item she had described. In 1902, Walker founded the St. Luke Herald to carry news of the Order of St. Luke to local chapters and to help with its educational work. The following year, she opened the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank (of which she would be remain president until 1929). In 1905, she opened the St. Luke Emporium, a department store that offered African American women opportunities for work and gave the Black community access to cheaper goods.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the midst of all of these accomplishments, however, tragedy visited Walker once more: In 1915, Russell Walker, mistaking his father for an intruder, shot and killed him as he was returning home one night. Russell was tried for murder, but was found innocent. Also around this time, Walker developed diabetes. Yet this did not deter her in her work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1921, Walker ran for the seat of superintendent of public instruction on the Republican ticket, though she was defeated along with the other Black Republican candidates. Her work for the Order of St. Luke, however, was meeting with much more favorable results. By 1924, under Walker's continued leadership, the bank served a membership of more than 50,000 in 1,500 local chapters. Additionally, she managed to keep the bank alive during the Great Depression, despite the fact that many were failing, by merging it with two other banks in 1929.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For the last few years of her life, Walker was confined to a wheelchair and continued to suffer from her diabetic condition, and on December 15, 1934, at age 70, she died from complications of the disease. She was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Richmond. In 1979, her home on East Leigh Street, in the Jackson Ward neighborhood of Richmond, known as the "Harlem of the South," was purchased by the National Park Service and became a National Historic Site.</p><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Maggie Lena Walker</li><li>Birth Year: 1864</li><li>Birth date: July 15, 1864</li><li>Birth State: Virginia</li><li>Birth City: Richmond</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Maggie Lena Walker was grand secretary of the Independent Order of St. Luke, an organization dedicated to the social and financial advancement of African Americans.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Education and Academia</li><li>Business and Industry</li><li>Journalism and Nonfiction</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Independent Order of St. Luke</li><li>Lancaster School</li><li>Richmond Colored Normal School</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1934</li><li>Death date: December 15, 1934</li><li>Death State: Virginia</li><li>Death City: Richmond</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Maggie Lena Walker Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/maggie-lena-walker</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: September 11, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=32 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow.</li><li>A healthy community is one in which the elderly protect, care for, love and assist the younger ones to provide continuity and hope.</li><li>I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth, but a laundry basket practically on my head.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiZrquZo7K0v4ylnJqclafAcLnAoJ6inV2hsq%2BtjLCYpaOVpw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./paolina-van-kleef.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paolina van Kleef  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
