season yardage goal of over 1,000 yards.</p><h3>Endorsement</h3><p>One of the most critical aspects of an NFL player’s long career is consistency.</p><p>Mike is one of the most successful and consistent players in the league’s history, allowing him to contact and sign deals with various sponsors.</p><p>The Super Bowl Champion has been a long-time supporter of Pepsi, a global soft drink
