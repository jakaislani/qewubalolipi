Interestingly, <b>Nezuko's physical abilities reach the level of an Upper Rank in her Awakened form</b>. And that's the reason why she regenerated her body parts so quickly.</span></span><h2>Why is Nezuko so powerful?</h2>In her demonic form, Nezuko grew larger, adopting an adult appearance. Vine-like patterns appeared on her body while a single horn protruded out of her head. This form also enhanced her speed and power, which is a huge boost, considering Nezuko had smashed half of Daki's head with a single kick in her normal form.<h2>Why is Nezuko immune to sunlight?</h2>However, she wasn't immune to the sunlight initially, as she got burned badly at first. So, in conclusion, her coming from a Sun Breathing user's lineage and not relying on human substance are perhaps the reasons for her immunity.<h2>Is Nezuko as strong as an upper moon?</h2>Nezuko doesn't stand a chance against the Upper Moon 3<p>Nezuko is undoubtedly a strong demon in Demon Slayer and she proved her strength repeatedly. One situation that really displayed her true potential was the fight against Daki. She underwent a transformation and thoroughly overwhelmed the Upper Moon 6 demon.</p><h2>What demon rank is Nezuko?</h2>Nezuko overpowering an Upper Rank demon. Overall Abilities: Despite not being a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Nezuko is a very powerful demon.<h2>How Strong is Nezuko Kamado? (Demon Slayer / Kimetsu no Yaiba Full Power Explained)</h2><p></p><h2>Can Nezuko be in the sun?</h2>Nezuko isn't like other demons, which is how she was given the name "The Chosen Demon." The reason behind this is because unlike other demons, she can actually walk in the sunlight without getting burned.<h2>How does Nezuko eat?</h2>Unlike other demons who survive on blood, Nezuko never really needs it, and she doesn't even consume human food either. Moreover, Nezuko has never shown any signs of undernourishment as she is always ready to assist her brother with her overwhelming strength and deadly Blood Demon Art.<h2>Why does Nezuko sleep so much?</h2>Nezuko doesn't eat people; Tanjiro won't let her. He doesn't want her to become fully demon, and she obviously doesn't want to hurt anyone. So, in order to compensate for the lack of "nutrients," Nezuko is constantly sleeping. This also causes her to regenerate much slower than a normal demon.<h2>Is Tanjiro Hashira level?</h2>Tanjiro did not become a Hashira towards the end of the series but defeating Muzan is enough reason to say that he is Hashira level. He was trained by Urokodaki and learned the Breath of the Water, which is considered a difficult sword technique. He mastered Full Focus Breathing, which only the Hashira can do.<h2>What is Nezuko's regeneration speed?</h2>Nezuko's regeneration speed matches that of an upper moon, and later it's mentioned that it surpasses the regeneration speed of one of the upper moons. Also, Nezuko has shown to be stronger than an average demon before, when she kicked those strong demon balls for example.<h2>What happens if Nezuko tastes blood?</h2>If Nezuko were to taste blood, it's likely that she would lose control completely, forcing Tanjiro and other demon slayers to kill her. So the bamboo gag really protects Nezuko as well as the other humans the slayers may encounter on their journey.<h2>Why does Nezuko bite bamboo?</h2>The reason Nezuko has bamboo is to hide her demon fangs from the world. It's also an extra layer of defense in case she becomes feral again and tries to attack someone. She initially received her bamboo muzzle in Chapter 1. Demon Slayer Giyu Tomioka placed the bamboo in her mouth after knocking her unconscious.<h2>Who is the strongest Demon Slayer?</h2>2 Yoriichi Tsugikuni Is The Only One Muzan Ever Feared<p>Yoriichi Tsugikuni deserves the honor of being the single-strongest Demon Slayer to ever exist.</p><h2>Who can Nezuko beat?</h2>Given that she survived the Final Selection, she has excellent combat abilities. But Nezuko single-handedly overwhelmed Daki, showing just how strong she is as a demon. Therefore, it can be assumed that Nezuko would be able to beat Aoi if the two engaged in combat.<h2>How is Nezuko stronger than Daki?</h2>Pushed into an all-consuming rage, Nezuko transformed into a grown adult with vine tattoos on her body and a jagged horn on her head. In this state, referred to as her Berserker Form, she easily overpowered Daki, who holds the rank of Upper-Moon Six (a title she shares with her brother).<h2>Is Nezuko a hybrid?</h2>'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba' chapter 195 reveals why Muzan dreaded Yoriichi, Nezuko turns into human-demon hybrid? The “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” chapter 195 release date is just a couple of days away.<h2>Who is the oldest Hashira?</h2>13 Gyomei Himejima Is The Oldest Hashira (26)<p>Gyomei is not only the oldest—26 years old, to be exact—but the tallest out of the Hashira and the main cast. His appearance may be intimidating, but he's a lot gentler than people think.</p><h2>Who is the 2nd strongest Hashira?</h2><p>Demon Slayer: Every Member Of The Hashira, Ranked In Terms Of...</p><ul><li>6 Obanai Iguro, The Serpent Hashira. ...</li><li>5 Mitsuri Kanroji, The Love Hashira. ...</li><li>4 Muichiro Tokito, The Mist Hashira. ...</li><li>3 Giyu Tomioka, The Water Hashira. ...</li><li>2 Sanemi Shinazugawa, The Wind Hashira. ...</li><li>1 Gyomei Himejima, The Stone Hashira.</li></ul><h2>Can Tanjiro beat DEKU?</h2>Tanjiro would win, because Deku have no way of killing Tanjiro. Deku may be stronger but in the end Tanjiro would win by stamina or landing a hit at Deku, which have poison that would kill Deku.<h2>Why is Tanjiro's head so hard?</h2>Tanjiro's head is hard to crack to the extreme! The major literary reason for Tanjiro having such a hard head is to be symbolic of his determination and fighting style. Time and time again, Tanjiro is shown to press forward and fight on even when all hope seems lost.<h2>Who has Marechi blood?</h2>Sanemi has Marechi blood, a rare blood that could intoxicate any demon. You can see she was drooling, yet she tried her best to resist the blood. This scene is nothing but to show how strong-willed Tamado Nezuko is.<h2>Why is Nezuko's hair red?</h2>Later in the series, colorful streaks appear, but why did Nezuko's hair change color? Nezuko's hair seemed to change color because she became a demon. Most demons have colorful streaks in their hair, and Nezuko seemingly received hers right after becoming …<h2>How long was Nezuko sleep for?</h2>After a short lecture and test of strength, the siblings are taken in by Sakonji, who then begins training Tanjiro in the Water Breathing Breathing Style. Nezuko then sleeps for the full two years Tanjiro spends training, not even awakening after he leaves for the Final Selection.<h2>What is Nezuko's box made of?</h2>“This was the box I carried my sister in during the day. It is made with an extremely light type of wood called “Mist Cloud Fir.” After painting it with “Rock Paint,” the outer layer hardens, strengthening its durability.” The reason Nezuko sleeps in a box is to protect her from sunlight.<h2>Does Giyuu have a sister?</h2>Tsutako Tomioka ( 冨 とみ 岡 おか 蔦 つた 子 こ , Tomioka Tsutako?) was the older sister of Giyu Tomioka.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahsGabkaN6r7HZrqKoZaKatKa6xKuYrZ1dqLxussCsqw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fight-club-punching-in-the-dark.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fight Club: Punching in the Dark | Scanners">&larr;
